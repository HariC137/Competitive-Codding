#Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

#To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

#To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

class Solution:
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, A: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        for i in range(0,len(A)):
            A[i].reverse()
        print(A)
        for i in range(0,len(A)):
            for j in range(0,len(A)):
                A[i][j] = int(not(A[i][j]))
        return A
