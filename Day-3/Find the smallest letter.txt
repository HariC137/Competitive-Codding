# Given a list of sorted characters letters containing only lowercase letters, and given a target letter target, find the smallest element in the list that is larger than the given target.

#Letters also wrap around. For example, if the target is target = 'z' and letters = ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'. 

class Solution:
    def nextGreatestLetter(self, letters: List[str], target: str) -> str:
        least = []
        for i in letters:
            if ord(i)> ord(target):
                least.append(i)
        if len(least) == 0:
            letters.sort()
            return letters[0]
        least.sort()
        return(least[0])
