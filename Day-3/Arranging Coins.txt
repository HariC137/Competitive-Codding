#You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

#Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

#n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        i = 1
        ctr = 0
        temp = n
        while(i <= temp):
            temp -= i
            ctr += 1
            i += 1
        return(ctr)
